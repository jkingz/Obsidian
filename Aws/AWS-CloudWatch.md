# Create an IAM role for CloudWatch Agent
#### To setup aws cutom logs, first, you need to create and add a custom ec2 IAM role to your instance. This IAM role will have policies with write access to the CloudWatch service so that all the logs from ec2 instances can be shipped to CloudWatch.

##### Steps:
	1. Head over to AWS IAM -> Policies -> Create Policy

#### Add the CloudWatch Role to the instance
	1. Head over to ec2 and select the instance in which you want to configure the custom logs.
	2. Right-click for options and select Security and then choose Modify IAM ROLE option.
	3. Select the custom cloud watch IAM role from the dropdown and save it.

#### Install CloudWatch Logs Agent
	SSH into the ec2 instance and follow the steps given below:
	 wget https://s3.amazonaws.com/amazoncloudwatch-agent/ubuntu/amd64/latest/amazon-cloudwatch-agent.deb
	sudo dpkg -i amazon-cloudwatch-agent.deb

##### If you are just starting with cloud watch agent, it is better to run the cloud watch agent wizard that helps you create the log agent configuration.

	 sudo /opt/aws/amazon-cloudwatch-agent/bin/amazon-cloudwatch-agent-config-wizard

The final config files get stored in the following location

	 /opt/aws/amazon-cloudwatch-agent/bin/config.json

If you want to collect the system metrics, install collected on your server.

	 sudo apt-get update -y 
	 sudo apt-get install collectd

Now let start the CloudWatch agent using the following command:

	 sudo /opt/aws/amazon-cloudwatch-agent/bin/amazon-cloudwatch-agent-ctl -a fetch-config -m ec2 -c file:/opt/aws/amazon-cloudwatch-agent/bin/config.json -s

You can check the agent status using the following command.

	 sudo /opt/aws/amazon-cloudwatch-agent/bin/amazon-cloudwatch-agent-ctl -a status

### Validating Custom Logs in Cloudwatch Dashboard
Once the setup is done, you can view all the configured logs under the cloudwatch dashboard (under the logs option)

	1. Go to Logs â€“> Log Groups and you will see the log group you mentioned in the agent configuration.
	2. Select the log group and you should see the instance identified you mentioned in the config.
	3. If you click the instance identifier, it shows all the logs. You can use the cloud watch filter option to filter and query required logs.
